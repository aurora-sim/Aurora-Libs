The files in this directory are used to generate the lsl.lexer.cs and
lsl.parser.cs files found in OpenSim. Standard procedure would be to edit the
lsl.lexer/lsl.parser files to update the compiler, then generate the .cs files
with lg.exe and pg.exe. lg.exe, pg.exe and Tools.dll are built from the sources
in the Tools/ directory.

The CSCodeGenerator.cs and LSL2CSCodeTransformer.cs files are included here for
testing purposes. The tests in the tests/ directory are also reproduced in the
OpenSim tree in OpenSim/Tests/OpenSim/Region/ScriptEngine/Shared/CodeTools/.
The output.cs file is a simple program that takes an LSL file as input and
produces C# code, or with the -t parameter specified AFTER the filename, it
prints the Abstract Syntax Tree.

NOTE: In lsl.lexer.cs there is an "Unreachable code detected" warning. This is
caused by a return statement in a switch statement followed by a break.
Removing the break statement is sufficient to remove the warning.

Instructions:

Run make. Use the runtests.sh script to run all the tests.

output.exe takes the LSL source file as its first argument and generates C#
code on standard out. If you would like to see the AST instead append -t AFTER
the LSL source file.

Files and Directories:
    Tools/
        Contains the source code for the lexer generator and parser
        generator. Download CSTools.zip from
        http://cis.paisley.ac.uk/crow-ci0/
    tests/
        Contains a bunch of files I use for testing. The .lsl files contain
        LSL source while the .cs files are the expected generated code.
    CSCodeGenerator.cs
        This class performs the code generation from the AST.
    LSL2CSCodeTransformer.cs
        This class performs necessary transformation of the AST. Currently
        only type names are changed (ie: integer -> LSL_Types.LSLInteger).
    lsl.lexer
        The description of LSL tokens.
    lsl.parser
        LSL syntax in BNF.
    Makefile
        Yeah...
    output.cs
        Currently the "compiler" I use for testing.
    README
        This file.
    runtests.sh
        Shell script which will run each of the tests in the tests/ dir and
        report success or failure.
